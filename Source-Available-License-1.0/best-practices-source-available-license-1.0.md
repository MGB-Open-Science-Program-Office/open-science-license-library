#  MGB Source Available License 1.0 Best Practices Guide

Source-Available and Open-Source describe different approaches to software distribution and use. The main difference between the two is the degree of freedom granted to Licensees regarding the usage, modification, and distribution of the software's source code, Data, and other Model Materials.

# Use Case

MGB 1.0, in contrast to MGBSA 1.0 , generally adheres to the established set of Open Source principles that ensure a high degree of freedom. Software licensed under MGB 1.0 can be freely used for any purpose, and licenses must comply with criteria such as source code availability, free redistribution, and the allowance of modifications and derived works. Thus, while Open Source license are frequently seen as participatory, in that any Contributor can propose a change, and other developers (Maintainers) have permissions (Commit Access) to edit Projects, Source Available licenses merely make the source code available to view. MGBSA 1.0 gives the Licensee - Users no legal rights to use, share, modify or even compile the shared code. Although many authors claim little to no difference between SA and OS models, these diverging approaches may have a greater effect down the line than mere anti-competition. For example, say the authors make a large negative change to a software’s pricing model or development direction which negatively impacts its user-base. In an open source scenario this can provide the opportunity for a fork (or redistribution) if there’s enough user demand. A new business can be formed around the use-case the software is already suited for, whereas the MGBSA 1.0 significantly hinders forking efforts for anyone but the author. It is important to note that functionally all public Github repositories CANNOT be disable forking or scanning bots that scan new GitHub commits. Please consult with your Innovation Licensing Manager and consider a non-open science approach regarding the distribution of proprietary intellectual property.

# Foundational Summary

MGBSA 1.0 allows users to access the source code, but it also imposes restrictions on how the software can be used (non-commercially), modified, or redistributed (no redistribution). The goal of MGBSA 1.0 is to limit commercial activities and  prevent forking, while still allowing users to access the source code, data, and Materials.

# Requirements

Anyone who uses Source Available Materials licensed under MGBSA 1.0 is allowed to use and distribute the Licensed Code and Data solely for non-commercial, non-revenue generating, research purposes.  But unlike the MGB Open Access NC License 1.0, users can only distribute the Licensed Materials if it is unchanged without any modifications, also for non-commercial purposes.

# Restrictions on Using the Licensed Code:
1.	No Commercial Use:  MGBSA 1.0 is solely for non-commercial, non-revenue generating, research purposes.
2.	No Forking:  Licensee - Users may only distribute the unmodified Data and Materials, and only for noncommercial and non-revenue generating purposes.
3.	No Implied Rights to related software:  Nothing in MGBSA 1.0  grants any third party or software rights even if necessary to use or distribute the Work licensed under this License. Licensees are responsible for obtaining and maintaining their own licenses, at its own cost and expense, to any such third-party rights.
4.	No Implied Warranties, No Representations, and No Liability for Any Damages: The Work licensed under the MGBSA 1.0 License is provided by licensor and contributors “as is”.
5.	No Trademark or Name License:  The MGBSA 1.0 License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor (Mass General Brigham Incorporated in this case), except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
6.	Included Data; Personal Information. Although the Work licensed MGB 1.0 may include data, graphs, and / or model materials, You may have obligations to comply with laws and policies concerning personal data or patient health information, and MGB 1.0 does not excuse those legal obligations.

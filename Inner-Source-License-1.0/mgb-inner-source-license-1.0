MGB Inner Source License Version 1.0

PREFACE

The MGB Inner Source License is a software license under which software can be freely used and developed within Mass General Brigham Incorporated (“MGB”), where the source code is available to all software developers within MGB. This license enables collaborative development similar to well-known open source models within the organization without the risk of sensitive intellectual property becoming public outside of MGB.
The MGB ISL is based on a so-called "copyleft" type license, which not only ensures that source code is available and can be used freely, but also that contributed modifications and further developments must be made accessible under the same conditions so that the greatest innovative value can be derived from the shared and developed code.
In addition to the legal framework for sharing code within an open-source-like development model, the MGB ISL also provides the basis for adapting elements of open-source culture where they can help increase collaboration, eliminate silos, and make processes more efficient and transparent to the benefit of scientific research and clinical care. 
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
